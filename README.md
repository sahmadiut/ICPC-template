## Usage

1. **Editing Problems:** Navigate to the `problems` directory. Each problem should be placed in its own sub-directory, and the problem statement should be written in a `problem.tex` file within that sub-directory.

2. **Adding Problems:** To add a new problem, create a new sub-directory in the `problems` directory and add the corresponding `problem.tex` file. Ensure that the problem statement adheres to the format provided in the existing problem files.

3. **Updating Main File:** After adding or editing problems, update the `main.tex` file to include the paths to the new or modified problem directories. This ensures that the problems are compiled and included in the final document.
